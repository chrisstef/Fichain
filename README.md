<!-- ## Fichain | A Blockchain & Cryptocurrency app

![frontend](fichain-frontend.png)


## Background

Understanding Blockchain isn't easy. At least it wasn't for me. 
I had to go through number of frustrations due to a few funcional open source examples of how this technology works.
And I like learning by doing so if you do the same, allow me to guide you and by the end you will have a functioning blockchain.
To take it a step further, I connected the blockchain with a frontend UI to provide a solid idea of how blockchains work.


## So, what is blockchain?

Remember that a Blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. 
The important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.
They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really! 
The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the transparency and security of a record of data,
and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.


## About the application

**My workflow:**

- Building the Blockchain Application with Python.
- Testing the Application using Pytest.
- Incorporate the crucial concept of Proof of Work into the Blockchain.
- Enhance the application to prepare for networking.
- Create the Blockchain network using Flask and Pub/Sub.
- Integrate the Cryptocurrency, building Wallets, Keys, and Transactions.
- Extend the network implementation with the cryptocurrency.
- Transition from Python to JavaScript to continue with building the frontend.
- Establish frontend-backend connections and begin coding with React.js.
- Create the frontend portion for the blockchain portion of the system.
- Complete the frontend by building a UI for the cryptocurrency portion of the system.

At the moment, there is an initial deployment but there are more actions needed to be made,
in order to deploy both Flask and React subfolders and estabilish a full deployment (propably on Heroku).
